				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hi, I'm Steven Sawtelle! I'm currently working with the Philanthropy Engineering team to develop
					tools that make engaging employees in philanthropic events easier as a Software Engineer at
					Bloomberg, and I love it. In the past, I've interned at <a class="linked" rel="nofollow"
						href="https://google.com/" alt="Google">Google</a>, <a class="linked" rel="nofollow"
						href="https://psware.com/" alt="Performance">Performance Software</a> and <a class="linked" rel="nofollow"
						href="https://viasat.com/" alt="ViaSat">ViaSat, Inc.</a> and spent an amazing
					semester in 2017 studying abroad at the <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="http://nus.edu.sg/"
						alt="NUS">National University of Singapore</a>, where I took classes in Advanced Data Structures
					and Algorithms, Game Design, Bollywood Studies, and Linguistics, and just generally fell in love
					with everything about Singapore. I'm a proud <a class="linked" rel="nofollow" href="http://asu.edu/"
						alt="ASU">Arizona State University</a> grad.</p>
				<p>I'm all about Software Engineering for good, so that's where I'm hoping to spend most of my career.
					If you want to talk about this with me, please feel free to reach out!</p>
				<p>A non-exhautive list of topics I can talk about until we're both exhausted: reading(<a href="/books"
						class="nav">check out what books I've read recently!</a>), writing(<a href="/blog" class="nav">check out my
						blog</a>), 3D printing, hiking, crossword and other puzzles, plotting,
					woodworking, game and escape room design, public policy, budget travel, and data visualization.</p>
				<p>Finally, this site is open source! Check it out <a class="linked" rel="nofollow"
						href="https://github.com/StevenSawtelle/stevensawtelle.github.io" alt="site_source">here</a>,
					and let me know if there's things I could do better - I'm new to this whole front end world.</p>
